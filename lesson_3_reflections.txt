1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repo means there is a backup in the cloud. It makes it easier to share the work accross multiple computers.
It also means it can be shared with multiple collaborators. 

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes automatically might introduce new versions at HEAD that intefere with work you were doing in your local repo, 
especially if working on a joint project with many collaborators
