1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git will setup the hidden .git folder in an initial state. 
Git does not commit any files or make any new branches. 
Without initialising the .git folder Git does not treat the parent folder as a repository and so you can not add files or commit them.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area appears to be a concept rather than a tangeble thing that can be seen. 
Its value is to allow a working area for changes to files that are under version control by Git in the repository. 
The working directory is the parent directory holding the .git hidden directory and the repository. 
It is in essence just a directory and can hold files that are not under version control by Git and files that are. 
Staging area only holds files that are under version control, and can be changed. 

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can make changes to many files in the working directory. But you can add a subset of those files to the staging area and then commit them. 
You can add them to staging and still make further changes, thus using the staging area as a temp storage for a known good version prior to commiting it.
